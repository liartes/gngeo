-- General question --
1. What is Gngeo?
	Gngeo is a neogeo emulator for Linux.
	
2. What are the requirement?
	Gngeo depend on the folowing libs:
	 . libSDL (1.2.x) from http://www.libsdl.org
	 . zlib   from http://www.zlib.org
	Also, if you're under a Pentium class processor, I recommend you to
	install nasm (0.98), so you can profit of i386asm and mmx optimisation.
	If you want opengl blitter, you need opengl dev header.
	Of course, you need a NeoGeo bios. A neogeo bios consist of the folowing
	files: neo-geo.rom, ng-sfix.rom and ng-lo.rom
	
3. Which platform are supported?
	The principal devellopement platform is linux for i386. But gngeo
	is portable, and it should compile on different architecture and OS.
	Actually, Gngeo is regulary tested on UltraSPARC (linux and solaris).
		
4. Which features does Gngeo have?
	. Relatively fast emulation (PII 300 in enougth in most case)
	. Emulate arcade and home system
	. Raster effect (use in super side kick 2,3,4 and some other game)
	. Nebula/Kawaks transparency pack support
	. Interpolation between frame (smoother animation)
	. Soft, Opengl and YUV blitters
	. Many different effects (scanline, scale2x etc.)
	. Save state
	. Free as in free speech

-- Installation/configuration --

5. How do I install gngeo?
	First, you have to install the folowing lib: libsdl and zlib.
	This lib are available in nearly every distribution (you may have
	to install a separate devel package ). If it's not the case, you can
	grab the source at http://www.libsdl.org and http://www.zlib.org
	If you are under an i386 compatible platform, then install nasm
	(http://www.web-sites.co.uk/nasm) for asm optimisation.
	Now you can compile gngeo with the folowing command (do not type the $ ):
	$ ./configure
	$ make
	
	Then, as a super user:
	# make install

	Next step is the installation of the neogeo bios. The default place is
	$prefix/share/gngeo, but you can install it every where, if you tell
	gngeo where to search. To install the bios, just copy the 3 rom
	(neo-geo.rom, ng-sfix.rom and ng-lo.rom) to the desired location.
	Ex: You have your bios in /home/plop/neorom and you want to start
		viewpoint (also in /home/plop/neorom)

	$ gngeo -i /home/plop/neorom /home/plop/neorom/viewpoin.zip
	
	The option -i tell to Gngeo to search roms in /home/plop/neorom
	
	For mame lovers, you can also use the folowing command line :
	$ gngeo -i /home/plop/neorom viewpoin
	Gngeo will search the rom in /home/plop/neorom
	
6. How do I configure it?
	All the configuration of Gngeo is done in one file: $HOME/.gngeo/gngeorc
	A sample file is provide in the source distribution: sample_gngeorc
	To configure Gngeo copy this file to $HOME/.gngeo/gngeorc and edit it.
	Every option are also accessible on the command line (please refer to
	man page).
	Generaly, the option you may first look at is rompath : this define the
	path where gngeo search the neogeo bios (-i on the command line).

	Keyboard configuration:
	The easiest way to configure your keyboard is with the folowing method:
	- start gngeo with a game (no matter wich one)
	- press the F4 key.
	- Now, every time you press a key, its scancode is print one the screen.
	- So, you just have to press successively the press you want to use, and
	  note the associated scancode somewhere.
	- Now edit your gngeorc file at the line p1key (or p2key), and modify
	  the default scancode with yours

	You can do exactly the same with joystick configuration (p1joy & p2joy).
	p1joy corespond to /dev/js0 and p2joy to /dev/js1 (you can invert this
	order with the option --invertjoy)

9. Some game does nothing. I got only a blank screen...
	Some game doesn't have a valid initial PC. Try to start gngeo with th
	--forcepc option, it should correct your problem. If it's not the case,
	please make a bug report.
	
-- Misc --

10. What is a transparency pack, and how I use it?
	Transparency pack have been introduced with Nebula and Kawaks.
	This is basicly a file that define which sprite should be draw with
	transparency. For example, explosion in Blazing Star or special effect
	move in King Of Fighters.
	You can find some pack in the nebula distribution (they	have .bld extension)
	It's pretty simple to use it with Gngeo, you just have to use the -t 
	option (ex: gngeo -t /mnt/dos/nebula/config/kof96DS.bld kof96)

11. What is raster effect?
	It's a special effect often use to simulate perspective 
	(for ex. in SuperSideKick  II,III and IV) or wave effect (Samy logo in
	Viewpoint or The fire stage in LastBlade2). Such effect need the
	emulation of HBlank interrupt, and thus, need a little more CPU power.
	Since this effect is use only by some game, raster effect are not 
	enable by default. You can enable it with the -r command line, or by 
	setting the raster option to true in your gngeorc.

12. What interpolation is for?
	Since NeoGeo hardware lack transparency support, programmers generally
	use blinking sprite to simulate it. By interpolating the current frame
	with the last one, sprite doesn't blink anymore and become transparent.

13. How can I get further help
	A Mailing list for Gngeo is available. This mailing list can be use to
	ask help to other people (including me). Please read the archive to
	verify that your question has not been already answered before you post.
